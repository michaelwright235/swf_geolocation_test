This repository contains two examples of using Geolocation class for Adobe AIR.
1. **geo_no_request**. An example of earliar code base without
requesting a permission (Geolocation.requestPermission and corresponding
event).
2. **geo_with_request**. Same with requesting a permission (more modern code).

You can run both examples on arm7a android device. Compiled using AIR 30.

The code is based on [this example from Adobe](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/as3/dev/WS144092a96ffef7cc-66bf4d0212658dde8c4-7fff.html).
